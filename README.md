# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi, I'm Luca, also known as @obiwan-kenobit. I am from Italy, and my pronouns are he/him.

I have a keen interest in the vast world of technology, exploring both hardware and software. Currently, I am diving into web development, learning HTML and CSS through The Odin Project.

I'm a huge fan of video games, especially the ones by FromSoftware. Games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring are my absolute favorites and often inspire my tech projects!

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you share similar interests or have any questions!
